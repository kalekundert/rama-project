Ramachandran Plot
=================
To culminate the programming module of bootcamp, you will write a program that 
generates Ramachandran plots from PDB files.  Ramachandran plots show how 
backbone torsion angles are distributed in proteins, and PDB files are commonly 
used to encode protein coordinates.

The two axes in a Ramachandran plot represent different torsion angles.  The 
horizontal axis represents the phi angles, which are defined by the C-CA-N-C 
atoms.  The vertical axis represents the psi angles, which are defined by the 
N-C-CA-N atoms.  Each residue in a protein has a phi angle and a psi angle, and 
each point on a Ramachandran plot represents one of these pairs.  

Different secondary structural elements are characterized by different regions 
in a Ramachandran plot.  For this reason, Ramachandran plots are used both to 
validate experimental structures and to predict computational structures.
